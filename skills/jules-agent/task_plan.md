# Task Plan: Jules Client GUI Wrapper

## Goal
Create a single-file HTML/JS/CSS GUI wrapper around the existing jules_client.py without modifying the client, including repo/branch dropdowns, session lists/status, and UX for all capabilities.

## Phases
- [x] Phase 1: Plan and setup
- [x] Phase 2: Research/gather information
- [ ] Phase 3: Execute/build
- [ ] Phase 4: Review and deliver

## Key Questions
1. What UX flows best cover all client capabilities (sessions, activities, sources)?
2. How will the single-file webapp interact with the python client without changing it?

## Decisions Made
- None yet.

## Errors Encountered
- None yet.

## Status
**Currently in Phase 3** - Implementing GUI wrapper and API bridge.
